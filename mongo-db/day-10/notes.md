**$sort Stage:**

The `$sort` stage in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework is utilized to order documents based on specified fields.

**Key Points:**

1. **Sorting Order:** Allows sorting documents in either ascending (1) or descending (-1) order based on specified fields.
2. **Multiple Fields:** Supports sorting based on multiple fields, enabling complex sorting criteria.
3. **Efficiency:** Placing `$sort` early in the aggregation pipeline can optimize performance by leveraging indexes efficiently.
4. **Syntax:** `{ $sort: { <field1>: <order1>, <field2>: <order2>, ... } }`.

**Example:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $sort: { "subscriberCount": -1 } }
])
```

In this example, documents are sorted by the `subscriberCount` field in descending order, showcasing channels with the highest subscriber counts first.

**$push Stage:**

The `$push` stage in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework is employed to aggregate values of a specified field into an array.

**Key Points:**

1. **Array Accumulation:** Accumulates values of a specified field from all documents in the group into an array.
2. **Nested Arrays:** Can be used to create nested arrays by pushing entire documents or specific fields.
3. **Use Cases:** Useful for aggregating related data into arrays, such as collecting all videos' titles.
4. **Syntax:** `{ $push: <expression> }`.

**Example:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$username", videos: { $push: "$videos.title" } } }
])
```

In this example, documents are grouped by `username`, and the `$push` operator accumulates the `title` field values from the `videos` array into an array named `videos` for each user.

**$unwind Stage:**

The `$unwind` stage in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework is utilized to deconstruct an array field from input documents, creating a separate document for each element of the array.

**Key Points:**

1. **Array Deconstruction:** Breaks down arrays into individual documents, duplicating other fields in each new document.
2. **Expanding Arrays:** Useful when processing or aggregating data stored in arrays.
3. **Performance Impact:** Unwinding large arrays can increase the number of documents in the pipeline, impacting memory usage and performance.
4. **Syntax:** `{ $unwind: <arrayField> }`.

**Example:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$videos" }
])
```

Certainly! Let's expand on the `$unwind` stage with more examples.

**$unwind Stage:**

The `$unwind` stage in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework is used to deconstruct an array field from input documents, creating a separate document for each element of the array.

**Key Points:**
- **Array Deconstruction:** Breaks down arrays into individual documents, duplicating other fields in each new document.
- **Expanding Arrays:** Useful when you need to process or aggregate data stored in arrays.
- **Performance Impact:** Unwinding large arrays can increase the number of documents in the pipeline, impacting memory usage and performance.
- **Syntax:** `{ $unwind: <arrayField> }`.

**Examples:**

**1. Unwind Array of Embedded Documents:**
```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$videos" }
])
```
In this example, the `videos` array field is deconstructed, creating a separate document for each video within the array.

**2. Unwind Nested Arrays:**
```json
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$items" },
  { $unwind: "$items.subitems" }
])
```
In this example, the aggregation first unwinds the `items` array and then unwinds the nested `subitems` array within each item.

**3. Preserve Null or Empty Arrays:**
```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $unwind: { path: "$videos", preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: true } }
])
```
This example preserves null or empty arrays while unwinding, ensuring that documents with null or empty arrays are not filtered out.

**4. Unwind and Group:**
```json
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$items" },
  { $group: { _id: "$items.product", totalQuantity: { $sum: "$items.quantity" } } }
])
```
In this example, the `items` array is unwound, creating a separate document for each item, which is then grouped by product to calculate the total quantity.

**5. Unwind and Project:**
```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$videos" },
  { $project: { _id: 0, username: 1, videoTitle: "$videos.title" } }
])
```
Here, the `videos` array is unwound, and then the output documents are projected to include only the `username` field along with the `title` of each video.

The `$unwind` stage provides flexibility in handling arrays within documents, allowing for a wide range of data processing and aggregation tasks.
In this example, the `videos` array field is deconstructed, creating a separate document for each video within the array.

**$project Stage:**

The `$project` stage in the MongoDB Aggregation Framework is used to reshape documents by including, excluding, or renaming fields, or by adding new fields with computed values.

**Key Points:**

1. **Reshaping Documents:** Allows specifying fields to include or exclude from output documents.
2. **Field Renaming:** Can rename fields by providing new field names.
3. **Computed Fields:** Creation of new fields with computed values using expressions within `$project`.
4. **Control Output:** Provides control over the structure and content of output documents.
5. **Syntax:** `{ $project: { <field1>: <value>, <field2>: <value>, ... } }`.

**Example:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $project: { _id: 0, username: 1, subscribers: "$subscriberCount" } }
])
```

In this example, the output documents include `username` and `subscriberCount` fields. The `_id` field is excluded from the output, and `subscriberCount` is renamed to `subscribers`.

**$sort Stage:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $sort: { "subscriberCount": -1 } }
])
```

**$push Stage:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$username", videos: { $push: "$videos.title" } } }
])
```

**$unwind Stage:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$videos" }
])
```

**$project Stage:**

```json
db.user.aggregate([
  { $project: { _id: 0, username: 1, subscribers: "$subscriberCount" } }
])
```

These adjusted examples use the collection name "user" instead of "user" for the aggregation operations.
